Excited to showcase my K72 Project, a 3D-based interactive web experience built using React.js and GSAP.
This project focuses on delivering smooth animations, immersive transitions, and depth-driven interactions to create a visually engaging user experience.

By integrating GSAP animations with React components, I explored advanced front-end concepts such as animation timelines, scroll-based effects, and performance-optimized UI rendering.

🔹 Tech Stack: React.js | GSAP | JavaScript | HTML | CSS
🔹 Key Highlights: 3D animations, smooth transitions, interactive UI
🔹 Project demo shown in the video 🎥

Building projects like this has helped me push beyond basic UI and dive into modern, animation-driven web development.
Feedback and suggestions are most welcome! 😊
